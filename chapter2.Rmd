# Descripion of the course

*What I have learned untill now about the course.*

- This week I started to learn the basics of doing analysis in **R** with the **RStudio** with the help of the course **"R Short and sweet"** on the Datacamp site.
- Reading the codes in RStudio helps to learn about the broad possibilities like the **Chunk options**, that make it possible to integrate different parts of material into one document
- The Github forum offers a new way of working with changes in files, that demands some patience and time.
